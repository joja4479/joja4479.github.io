## Projects

### **[PCB Assembly Line Simulation — Java, Spring Boot, REST, SQLite](https://github.com/joja4479/PCB_Simulation/tree/main)**

- Developed a modular Java-based simulation of a PCB assembly line using object-oriented design patterns (Strategy, Dependency Injection, REST Controller).

- Built a Spring Boot server to run simulations for multiple PCB types (Sensor, Gateway, Test) with configurable defect and station failure rates.

- Integrated a RESTful API for a decoupled Java client to trigger simulations and retrieve JSON-formatted reports.

- Implemented SQLite database persistence using JPA to store and retrieve simulation results via a /results endpoint.

- Serialized simulation reports with Gson and used custom controller logic to handle both GET and POST requests.

- Packaged client and server as independent Maven modules with clean separation of concerns and reusable simulation components.

### **[Golf Shot Data Analysis Pipeline — Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Web Scraping](https://github.com/joja4479/GolfGameAnalysis/tree/main)** 

- Built a personal data pipeline to ingest and process daily CSV exports from a golf launch monitor.

- Cleaned and normalized structured shot-level data including swing speed, spin rate, ball speed, launch angle, club type, and shot shape.

- Performed statistical analysis to compute average carry distances by club and benchmarked against professional standards via scraped reference data.

- Created data visualizations to identify trends and areas for improvement in training (e.g., distance consistency, shot dispersion).

- Designed reusable preprocessing and analysis scripts using Pandas and NumPy.

### **[Did Steroids Make Baseball More Fun?](https://github.com/joja4479/Do-Steroids-Make-Baseball-More-Fun-)** _(in progress)_

**Goal:**  Determine if the steroid era of baseball was more fun from a fan's perspective than the current era of baseball.

**Description:** I grew up in the 90's and baseball seemed more fun when I was a kid. With big hitters like Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. (my favorite player of all time) games were more exciting to watch. Using a dataset downloaded from http://seanlahman.com/, I will attempt to prove that baseball was more fun when steroids were running rampant throughout the league.

### **[An Analysis of My Personal Spending Habits](https://github.com/joja4479/spending)** _(in progress)_

**Goal:** Analyse my spending habits to assist in creating a budget.

**Description:** In order to create a budget, I am looking at my spending habits over the last two years to determine where I can cut back and save money. The data was downloaded from my bank's website as .csv files which I imported into a Pandas dataframe for analysis. I then visualize the data using Tableau to create a dashboard.
